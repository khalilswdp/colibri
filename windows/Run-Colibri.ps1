.SYNOPSIS
  Launch colibri on this machine. Thin wrapper over the `coli` launcher, which on
  Windows already auto-detects the NVIDIA GPU and sizes the VRAM expert tier from
  real free VRAM. We only resolve the model path and pass through options.

.DESCRIPTION
  Earlier this script hand-set COLI_CUDA / CUDA_EXPERT_GB env vars. That was wrong:
  the launcher wants the `--vram` flag (GB, 0=auto), not CUDA_EXPERT_GB, and it
  plans RAM+VRAM itself. A bare `coli chat` auto-enables CUDA when colibri.exe is a
  CUDA build and coli_cuda.dll sits next to it (both true after Build-Colibri.ps1).

.PARAMETER Model
  Path to the quantized model directory (e.g. C:\Users\...\GLM5.2).

.PARAMETER Action
  chat (default) | serve | plan | doctor  -> `coli <action>`.

.PARAMETER VramGB
  VRAM expert-tier budget in GB. 0 = auto (default; launcher sizes from free VRAM).
  A positive value forces the size via `--auto-tier --vram`.

.PARAMETER RamGB
  RAM budget in GB. 0 = auto (engine uses ~88% of available RAM).

.PARAMETER Mirror
  Optional second copy of the model on another drive (COLI_MODEL_MIRROR) to
  aggregate read bandwidth.

#     sessions), run sends the one-shot through its API, web opens the
#     dashboard that is already being served.
#  2) A raw engine (benchmark, another chat's private engine) has no API to
#     attach to -> wait for it, or quit; never silently double up.
